Validation:
	* Stochastic Local Search
	* Fast simple (grid which stop iterations if the precision decrease)
	* Find suitable parameters for C and gamma (C should be the max of the value assumed in the validation)

Command line parameters for models (C, gamma, #iterations for ranges, kernel)

Recall


Questions:
Does it perform training and the validation if it load the model?
